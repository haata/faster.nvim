# Faster.nvim

Faster.nvim is a Neovim plugin inspired by
[bigfile.nvim](https://github.com/LunarVim/bigfile.nvim).

bigfile.nvim concept and code for handling of big files has been used as a
starting point for faster.nvim.

Some Neovim plugins and features can make Neovim slow when editing big files and
executing macros. Faster.nvim will selectively disable some features when big
file is opened or macro is executed.

Faster.nvim also gives ability to define custom behaviours and features so user
can disable other plugins or Neovim options based on custom behaviour or the
ones already implemented in this plugin.

This plugin will have minimal impact on the speed of Neovim if no extra
configuration or plugins are used. But as more and more Neovim options are
enabled and plugins installed its impact can be significant.

# Speed comparison

Speed comparison was done with three neovim configs:

- Left: [Highly customized Neovim](https://github.com/pteroctopus/neovim-config) (a lot of plugins and options)
- Middle: Vanilla Neovim: `nvim -u NONE`
- Right: Highly customized Neovim (a lot of plugins and options) but with
  faster.nvim plugin

**NOTE!:** Speed will certainly be different for executions on different
computers and with different plugins. If your Neovim is slow even with
faster.nvim that means that some other plugin or options is used that is not
considered in faster.nvim. Resolution would be to find the offending plugin or
option and configure a new feature that faster.nvim can use as explained below.

# Installation

- lazy.nvim

```lua
return {
    'pteroctopus/faster.nvim',
    opts = {},
}
```

# Configuration

Call:

```lua
require('faster').setup()
```

Or if you use lazy.nvim use opts like below. Further Examples are going to
assume lazy.nvim is being used.

## Minimal configuration

```lua
return {
    'github.com/pteroctopus/faster.nvim',
    opts = {},
}
```

## Default configuration without function overrides:

```lua
opts = {
  -- Behaviour table contains configuration for behaviours faster.nvim uses

    -- big file is opened

      -- set to false
      on = true,
      -- Table which contains names of features that will be disabled when
      -- bigfile is opened. Feature names can be seen in features table below.
      -- features_disabled can also be set to "all" and then all features that

      -- Specificaly: lualine plugin is disabled when macros are executed because
      -- if a recursive macro opens a buffer on every iteration this error will
      -- happen after 300-400 hundred iterations:

## Full options for a behaviour

```lua
-- key is also a name this behaviour
test_behaviour = {
  -- Behaviour can be turned on or off. To turn on set to true, otherwise
  -- set to false
  on = true,
  -- Table which contains names of features that will be disabled when

        "vimopts", "syntax", "filetype" },
  -- init key takes a function that initializes the behaviour, for example sets
  -- autocommands based on some rule
  init = function() print('test_behaviour initialized') end,
  -- stop key takes a function that stops the behaviour, for example deletes
  -- autocommands and enable features if they were disabled by init
  stop = function() print('test_behaviour stopped') end,
},
```

## Full options for a feature

```lua
-- Feature table contains configuration for features faster.nvim will disable
-- and enable according to rules defined in behaviours.
-- Defined feature will be used by faster.nvim only if it is on (`on=true`).
-- Defer will be used if some features need to be disabled after others.
-- defer=false features will be disabled first and defer=true features last.
-- key is also a name of this feature
test_feature = {
  -- Feature will be used by faster.nvim only if on is set to true
  on = true,
  -- Features with defer=false will be disabled first
  defer = false,
  -- enable key takes a function that contains code that will enable a feature
  enable = function() print('this should enable a feature') end,
  -- disable key takes a function that contains code that will disable a feature
  disable = function() print('this should disable a feature') end,
  -- commands key takes a function that should be used to define commands that
  -- will enable/disable a feature in runtime
  commands = function()
    vim.api.nvim_create_user_command(
      'FasterEnableTestfeature', print('Test feature enabled'), {})
    vim.api.nvim_create_user_command(
      'FasterDisableTestfeature', print('Test feature disabled'), {})
  end,
},
```

# Commands

Although faster.nvim will disable and enable features based on the rules defined
in a behaviour it also offers convenience commands that can be used during
Neovim execution without restarting it.

Note that disabling and enabling features will work only if the feature has `on`
set to `true` in the configuration.

# TODO

- Implement checking toggle status of the feature before enable/disabling it. If
  something is disabled already it shouldn't be enabled after behaviour finishes
